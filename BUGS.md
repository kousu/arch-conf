- [ ] Configure idle spindown on spinning disks
  -  https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hdparm
  - hdparm -S
  tricky to do automatically because it's so dependent on the firmware of each specific disk what's available
    - this should work for SATA but NOT for SATA-over-USB
  - hd-idle[aur] seems to be the only reliable option for SATA-over-USB
- [ ] For some reason, kousu-base/kousu-base.install and kousu-desktop/kousu-desktop.install aren't getting run anymore
- [ ] GNOME/gdm: does NOT source /etc/profile
  - and this breaks tab-to-same-directory in the terminal because /etc/profile.d/vte.sh isn't loaded
  - there's a lot of discussion about this bullshit going back years, e.g.
    - https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/issues/2581
    - https://github.com/rmarquis/pacaur/issues/638#issuecomment-277485530

  - actually wayland does respect /etc/profile.d the problem is /etc/profile.d/vte.sh doesn't respect wayland /etc/profile.d/{localbin,podman-docker}.sh and my own ssh-agent.sh are all loaded correctly. it's that specific script. it bails out if not run under a terminal it knows about and in an interactive session. so just being a login session won't do it. - arch's rec is https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GNOME/Tips_and_tricks#New_terminals_adopt_current_directory to do exactly what I did. that seems shitty. I guess the issue is that it used to be standard for VTE terminals to themselves be login shells.

- [ ] Auto-encryption
  - [ ] Provide the 'take ownership' commands from the motd message as a script
  - [ ] Make that script scan and warn if there is more than one keyslot defined
  - [ ] Explain better that there's a risk of someone installing a backdoor key without the user noticing
- [ ] /etc/mkinitcpio.conf.d/\*
  - These files are critical but in the way of these things it's unclear who should control them. Should these files be owned by a package? Or generated by arch-install? If they're owned by a package then it's hard for other packages to adapt them, which they very much might have to do because packages don't know (without going out of their way) about disk layouts, RAIDs, encryption, etc. arch-install does know about encryption but if it creates the files and leaves them untracked there's a higher chance of them getting lost or corrupted .
