# `kousu-aur-art`

This package has the apps I use for creative work
that have to be installed from the AUR.

## Installation

Run

```
pikaur -P
```

in this folder.

You will need to have manually installed [`pikaur`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pikaur) first;
it is (intentionally) not part of the main repos so there is no automatic way to bootstrap it.

You may need to manually install other parts.
