  # how do I handle packages from the aur?
  # there's no aur package manager in the standard arch packages -- probably because they want you to prove you can deal with the aur before you start pulling in packages from it willy-nilly

  # Things I would like from the AUR:
  # https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/apostrophe - a competitor to ghostwriter, in GTK instead of KDE
  # https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dtach - it's better than tmux
  # xkcdpass  # password generator
  # firefox-clearurls - web privacy aid
  # firefox-decentraleyes - ditto
  # firefox-extension-privacybadger
)

# `source` has some basic support for handling local files
# but it expects them to all be in the top-level folder. It's not really meant for bundling an entire directory tree,
# and to handle a directory tree it expects to be given a .tar to extract into src/
# Instead, I've committed the contents of this package *directly* to src/.

package() {
  # often PKGBUILDs use install(1) here, because it lets them control permissions
  # but install(1) can't do folders recursively; so instead, just cp -r, and set any permissions directly with chmod
  # that's safe enough: this is *building* a package for later deployment, not installing on a live system where a temporary gap in permissions is a risk
  cp -rp * "${pkgdir}"

  chmod 750 "${pkgdir}"/etc/sudoers.d
  chmod 600 "${pkgdir}"/etc/sudoers.d/*

  # KDE config files are all 0600, and dirs are 0755
  # this doesn't set that; this sets 0600 for files and 0700 for dirs. But that's probably good enough.
  chmod -R u=rwX,go= "${pkgdir}"/etc/skel/.config/{k*,baloo*}
}

# and then i want to also figure out how/where to set KDE system defaults
# with GTK I know it's 'dconf' or 'gconf' (why are there two? who knows)
# and Firefox defaults too; plus extra Firefox extensions


# To control KDE settings:
# - add a file to src/etc/skel/.config/kdedefaults/
#   you can figure out what you need to edit by making a change in the GUI, then examining ~/.config/{kdeglobals,kwinrc}
#   whatever settings you see, copy them to the corresponding file *under* ~/.config/kdedefaults/.
# To control GTK/GNOME settings:
# - ...
# To control Firefox settings:
# - ...
# To control xsession settings:
# - if you're using sx, or xinit, or ...whazzit ~/.xsession
#
# In general, if you can't figure it out how to write a config file for a given app, you can do:
#   1. cp -r ~/.config A
#   1. make the change in the app's settings/GUI
#   2. cp -r ~/.config B
#   3. diff -ru A/ B/
# This should identify the change.
# Some apps don't use ~/.config, but they're getting rarer.


## Some tricky things that should be documented somewhere:
#
# - src/etc/systemd/system/user@.service: this symlink is the same as `systemctl mask user@.service`.
#   It disables `systemd --user`, an incomplete and buggy feature in systemd that causes more problems
#   than it solves: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/7261
#   XXX this is re-enabled for now: KDE doesn't get along without it, there's some error about dbus-launch :(
