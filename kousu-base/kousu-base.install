  # make pam_faillock(8) way less aggressive.
  # unlike fail2ban, faillock locks you out *from everywhere*
  # not just locking out the IP address or tty that's being attacked.
  # which means it's a good way to DoS someone you don't like: just ssh into their system three times.
  # oh oh it also *doesn't continue to count login attempts* while it has the account locked
  # which means it's missing data.
  # Also /etc/security/faillock.conf doesn't use a .d directory which makes it hard to config manage
  # so I have to fall back on this sketchy `lineinfile:` substitute
