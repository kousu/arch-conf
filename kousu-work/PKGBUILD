# This numbers the package versions by how many commits went into it: every published commit is a newer package.
# This will break if we ever rebase the master branch. Don't do that.
# Also: if we use this across a monorepo this has the quirk/feature that
#       every package built out of it has the same version, but that won't be preserved if we split them up.
